This repository is to classify cancerous images (IDC : invasive ductal carcinoma) vs non-IDC images. 
In this, I have  designed, developed, analysed and evaluated an appropriate deep learning model. 
I have build my own model and used the pretrained model with layers added to it. 
I have evaluated the models performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-curve and PR-curve.
 
 
 Deep Learning has had a tremendous amount of attention especially in medical image analysis.
