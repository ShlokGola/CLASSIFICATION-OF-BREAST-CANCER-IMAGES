This repository is to classify cancerous images (IDC : invasive ductal carcinoma) vs non-IDC images. 
In this, I have  designed, developed, analysed and evaluated an appropriate deep learning model. 
I have build my own model and used the pretrained model with layers added to it. 
I have evaluated the models performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-curve and PR-curve.
 
There are three code files for three different sizes i.e., 50* 50, 64* 64 and 32*32 to evaluate images in different sizes. The model comparison is also done to find out the best performing model.
I have also prepared the report of entire project.

This dataset consists of 5547 breast histology images of size 50 x 50 x 3.
